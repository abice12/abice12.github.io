# _The North Star_ Project

_The North Star_ Project deals with the anti-slavery newspaper published by Frederick Douglass between the years 1847 and 1851. It is a digital humanities project that draws from the digitized run of the paper available from the Library of Congress website.

### Key Themes
This project has two specific pieces that work in unison to highlight the significance of _The North Star_, and bring broader public awareness and attention to the paper. Key themes include:
* The spatial and thematic coverage of the paper (specifically the first article of each edition) over its publication
* The topics of the paper throughout its run

In combining traditional topic analysis with a more focused look at the spatial and thematic coverage within a sliver of the newspaper, this project hopes to highlight new ways scholars can work with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) texts. It also seeks to highlight how anti-slavery texts represented their movement as well as those who opposed it.
